# Rubiks-Solver
Web application to find the shortest possible solution to a 2x2 Rubiks Cube. 

# Video Demo: https://youtu.be/PX5OEW4qqNU](https://youtu.be/PX5OEW4qqNU)](https://youtu.be/PX5OEW4qqNU)

# Languages and Tools
- SpringBoot: Used to create backend endpoint, connect front and back ends through GET and POST methods, and to launch the web application.
- Java: Used for the solving algorithm, and to handle form submission from HTML
- HTML: Used to create the front end form and the result page
- CSS: Used to style the front end pages
- JavaScript: Did not use in the end result, but kept in project code to show how I previously used it to convert Form data into an array of numbers




- [x] End goal: be able to input the colours on each side of the cube, and then have the solution to solving it outputted to the user

# Task List
- [x] Create a simple frontend where the user can input a single value and submit it
- [x] User can input all the values and submit it somewhere (console to start)
- [x] Create a decent looking frontend where the user can input the colors on each side of the cube and submit it
- [x] Be able to take in the user's input and store it in a database
- [x] Create an endpoint for the java
- [x] Create an algorithm to take in these inputs and solve the rubiks cube (verify that this works with actual cube)
- [x] Have the algorithm output each move on the rubiks cube when the program is run
- [x] Have the final algorithm output the solution onto the window
- [x] Implement a reset button so that the user can begin the process again with a different colour scheme
- [ ] ~~Implement an error message to be thrown if the colour scheme is invalid~~
- [x] Done!
