# Rubiks-Solver
End goal: be able to input the colours on each side of the cube, and then have the solution to solving it outputted to the user



# Task List
- [x] Create a simple frontend where the user can input a single value and submit it
- [x] User can input all the values and submit it somewhere (console to start)
- [x] Create a decent looking frontend where the user can input the colors on each side of the cube and submit it
- [x] Be able to take in the user's input and store it in a database
- [x] Create an endpoint for the java
- [x] Create an algorithm to take in these inputs and solve the rubiks cube (verify that this works with actual cube)
- [x] Have the algorithm output each move on the rubiks cube when the program is run
- [x] Have the final algorithm output the solution onto the window
- [x] Implement a reset button so that the user can begin the process again with a different colour scheme
- [ ] Implement an error message to be thrown if the colour scheme is invalid
